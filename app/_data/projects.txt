The Wimbledon Pets website is a user-friendly platform built to showcase the range of dog care services offered. It features a detailed services listing, an about section introducing company, and dog carers, client testimonials, a contact form for easy inquiries. With responsive design optimized for all devices, the site ensures a seamless experience for users, whether on desktop or mobile. Enhanced for SEO, Wimbledon Pets ranks higher on Google, improving visibility and client engagement.

As a developer & founder for Wimbledon Pets, I decided to redevelop the website, transitioning from a Wix-based setup to a fully coded Next.js application deployed on Netlify. This move brought significant benefits both in performance and cost-efficiency. By eliminating Wix hosting fees, we reduced hosting costs to zero, and by optimizing the site for SEO, Wimbledon Pets now ranks higher on Google, resulting in lower marketing and advertising expenses.

The new site is optimized for seamless navigation on all devices, improving user satisfaction and accessibility for clients looking to book dog care services on the go. With a polished, responsive UI and improved performance, Wimbledon Pets has not only enhanced its brand presence but also improved customer experience, contributing to greater engagement and growth.

This project underscores the advantages of a custom-coded environment in Next.js, providing Wimbledon Pets with a cost-effective, scalable, and user-friendly solution for their digital presence.

🚀 Project Showcase: Taste Quest Application 🚀
Taste Quest is a user-friendly website designed to help food enthusiasts find recipes quickly based on recipe names. Powered by the Spoonacular API, Taste Quest allows users to search for recipes, apply filters like category, cuisine, diet, and intolerances, and view a full recipe in a clean, intuitive layout. The application is optimised for all devices, ensuring users can search for their favourite recipes on any device at any time.

Here’s what we accomplished:

🎨 Design & Prototyping: We used Figma to create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface. From wireframes to final prototypes, every detail was meticulously crafted to ensure a seamless user experience.

💻 Frontend Development: Implementing the design with Tailwind CSS allowed us to rapidly develop a responsive and modern UI. The utility-first framework was a game-changer in maintaining consistency and flexibility throughout the project.

🤝 Team Collaboration: Working closely with Hanna, we tackled challenges together, from brainstorming features to solving complex coding problems. Our teamwork ensured that the project met all our objectives and was completed on time.

🎓 Final Project: This application was not just another assignment; it was the culmination of our learning journey at Mindera Code Academy. We’re proud to have created something that showcases the skills and knowledge we’ve acquired over the course of the BootCamp.

I’m beyond excited (we’re talking full-body tingles!) to share my first animated banner created with Framer for React! 🎥✨


This project has been such a labor of love. I’ve poured my passion into every detail, pushing through the challenges and discovering so much along the way. Animation brings a whole new dimension to web design, and I can’t wait to keep diving deeper.

I’m thrilled to share this journey with the LinkedIn community and hear your thoughts on this first creation. Here’s to more animations, more creativity, and more learning! 🥂

Embarking on the development of Career Keys, we aimed to create a solution that not only aligns job seekers' resumes with the expectations of employers and expected keywords used in ATS but also elevates the overall job application experience. Career Keys emerged from a simple yet profound need: to bridge the gap between the skills job seekers possess and the qualifications employers seek. This user-focused single-page application, built with React and Node.js, leverages the power of AI for keyword extraction, offering job seekers a competitive edge by enhancing their resumes with the keywords from job descriptions.

Our clear objective was to develop a platform that could extract keywords from job listings, enabling users to customise their applications effortlessly. The choice of React and Node.js aimed at delivering a responsive, single-page application that offers a seamless and user-friendly experience across all devices. Despite the diverse backgrounds and limited time availability of our team members, we managed to navigate the complexities of development with a strategic division of tasks that leveraged each member's strengths and preferences.

Our successes along this journey have been many, from creating an intuitive user experience to seamlessly integrating external APIs. These milestones were not only a testament to our team's hard work and dedication but also a validation of the impact Career Keys has on the job application process. The project not only met our objectives, proving that with the right technology and a user-centric approach, we can significantly improve the way job seekers connect with potential employers.

Career Keys shows can be achieved when innovation meets determination. By addressing the challenges of the job application process, we've created a platform that simplifies resume customisation and empowers job seekers to present themselves in the best light possible, maximising their chances of success in the competitive job market.
